James Blackhat decided he wanted to give the buyers more of a selection and affordability.<br> What made the dealership different from the competitors was that Mr. Blackhat cared about the family that was buying the vehicle.<br> Blackhat offered free lifetime oil changes on the vehicles to assure it ran smoothly and never had any problems.<br> If your vehicle did break down you had free road size assistance.<br> Not only is this one of the most trusted dealerships in the area, but when your buying a car you're also entering a family.</p>
